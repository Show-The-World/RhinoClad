    Features & Options for Rhino Clad Windows

    Profile Depth: Our windows boast a depth of 4 1/2‚Äù, offering an optional wood interior jamb extension for those seeking a touch of natural elegance.

Exterior Material: Crafted with Extruded Aluminum Profiles, our windows come in a wide palette of exterior colors. For those seeking a sleeker finish, we offer the option of Anodized aluminum in clear or black.

Interior Material: The interior is made of UPVC, which stands for Unplasticized Polyvinyl Chloride - a 100% virgin material known for its durability. The fully welded corners ensure an exceptional seal against external elements. The standard color is a timeless Antique white, but we also offer customizable paint options for those seeking a unique touch.

Glass Insulation: Choose between double or triple insulated glass. Our windows come with Low E (Low Emissivity) coating, which reflects heat, ensuring your space remains comfortable. They're also filled with Argon Gas, a non-toxic gas that improves insulation, paired with a warm edge spacer to further enhance thermal performance.

Sealing: Our triple gasket system provides an excellent seal, ensuring optimal thermal performance and energy efficiency.

Reinforcement: For those larger window combinations, we offer reinforcement options to ensure stability and longevity.



    Performance Metrics

    U-Factor: Ranging from 0.88 to 1.22 W/m2K. The U-Factor measures how well a window insulates. A lower number indicates better insulation, making your space more energy-efficient.

ER (Energy Rating): Our windows score between 34 to 49. A higher ER number indicates better overall window energy efficiency.

Structural Performance: Our windows can withstand design pressures up to 5000Pa, which is equivalent to resisting wind speeds of 325kph. This ensures your windows remain steadfast in even the most challenging weather conditions.

Air and Water Infiltration Ratings: Our windows have received the highest ratings for resisting air and water infiltration, adhering to standards set by AAMA/WDMA/CSA101/I.S.2/A440-17.
