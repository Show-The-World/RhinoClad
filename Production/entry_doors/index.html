Insulating System
At the heart of our doors lies the Super Spacer® Cushion Edge™, a state-of-the-art insulating system. This flexible, U-shaped silicone foam tape is meticulously wrapped around our center decorative panel, acting as a cushion. But it's not just about comfort; with a vapor barrier backing and combined with Hot Melt butyl, this system ensures a superior WarmEdge seal. In simpler terms, it's a barrier that keeps the cold out and warmth in, ensuring your home remains cozy and energy-efficient.


Performance Features

Warm-Edge Benefits: Our doors are designed with superior silicone foam insulation, which means they have low thermal conductivity. This ensures that heat stays inside during cold months and outside during warmer months, optimizing your home's energy efficiency.

Silicone Foam Features: The silicone foam used in our doors boasts excellent UV resistance, ensuring the door's longevity even under the harshest sun. Additionally, it's designed to perform exceptionally well under extreme temperatures, ensuring durability and performance year-round.

Dual-Seal Performance: Our doors feature chamfered corners, which might sound technical, but it simply means the corners are designed for increased sealant depth. This design choice further enhances the door's insulation capabilities.

Safety and Comfort: Your safety is paramount. That's why our doors come with Tempered Safety Glass, designed to withstand impacts without shattering into sharp pieces. For added comfort, our doors feature Low E (Low Emissivity) coating filled with Argon Gas. This combination reflects heat, ensuring your space remains comfortable regardless of the weather outside.
